# 📱 Mobile App User Engagement Project

This project presents a detailed analysis of user engagement metrics within a mobile application. Using real-world-like behavioral data of over 20,000 app users, we aimed to uncover how users interact with the app, what keeps them engaged, and which factors contribute to churn.

---

## 💡 Project Overview

Understanding how users interact with your mobile app is crucial for product growth, marketing optimization, and retention strategies. In this project, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a comprehensive dataset and visualize user behavior across multiple touchpoints such as device type, session duration, subscription plan, churn risk, and more.

This analysis helps uncover patterns that guide data-driven decisions for:

* Enhancing user experience
* Optimizing feature placement
* Boosting in-app purchases
* Minimizing churn
* Personalizing content and notifications
